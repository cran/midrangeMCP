Description: Apply tests of multiple comparisons based
    on studentized 'midrange' and 'range' distributions. 
    The tests are: Tukey Midrange ('TM' test),
    Student-Newman-Keuls Midrange ('SNKM' test), 
    Means Grouping Midrange ('MGM' test) and 
    Means Grouping Range ('MGR' test). The first two tests were published by 
    Batista and Ferreira (2020) <doi:10.1590/1413-7054202044008020>. 
    The last two are being published.
