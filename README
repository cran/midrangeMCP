This package can be installed as a regular R package, that is,
   install.packages(midrangeMCP)

if the GTK+ library is not already installed on your system,
installation may fail.

On Windows, the user must set the GTK_PATH environment variable to the
location of the root directory of the GTK+ library (ie \c:\opt\gtk). Try
downloading the GTK+ bundle from:

http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win64/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101229_win64.zip
or
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/binaries/win32/gtk+/2.22/gtk+-bundle_2.22.1-20101227_win32.zip

Then add the path to its “bin” subfolder (e.g., c:\opt\gtk\bin) to your system PATH environment
variable.

Another alternative for installing the GTK + library
in R software itself is install and load
the gWidgetsRGtk2 package in advance on R:
   install.packages("gWidgetsRGtk2")
   library(gWidgetsRGtk2)

A new window dialog window will appear, asking if you want to install “GTK+”.
Select “Install GTK” and then “OK”. This way the GTK + library will be installed automatically.

To install PCCor on Linux, you have to first install the following
required dependencies. On Debian and Ubuntu-based systems,
to install those packages open a terminal and type:
  sudo apt-get install r-cran-cairodevice r-cran-rgtk2 libcairo2-dev libatk1.0-dev libpango1.0-dev libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev


This README file was written based on the INSTALL and README files of RGTk2 and
MODIStsp packages, respectively. Of which the latter was very well detailed.
